    <h1 style="color: black;"> wanted to apologize for my annoying behavior yesterday. I know it wasn't fair to you, and I feel terrible for bringing you down.  Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?

        In the meantime, I just wanted to wish you a truly fantastic day. You deserve nothing but sunshine and good vibes. Sending you all the positive energy! âœ¨
    
    please forgive this 4yr old for his behavior
